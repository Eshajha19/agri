# 🌾 Fasal Saathi

Fasal Saathi is a smart agriculture assistance platform built with React (frontend), Python (backend) and Firebase (database/auth). The app delivers crop recommendations, weather-based alerts, soil health analysis, and fertilizer guidance to help farmers make informed decisions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🌱 Crop recommendation based on soil profile and regional climate
- ☁️ Real-time weather updates and custom farming alerts
- 🧪 Soil health analysis & nutrient suggestions
- 🪴 AI-based crop disease detection from uploaded images
- 🌾 Fertilizer and pesticide guidance
- 📊 Responsive and user-friendly dashboard (React)
- 🔐 Authentication & user profiles (Firebase)
- 🌐 Multi-language support (planned / optional)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js (Vite)
- Backend: Python (FastAPI)
- Database: Firebase (Firestore / Realtime DB)
- Auth: Firebase Authentication
- External APIs: Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap), Soil/Agro data APIs
- Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Render (backend - in process)

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KGFCH2/agri.git

```bash
cd frontend
```

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Start Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

### 3. Backend (Python — FastAPI)

```bash
cd ..
```

#### Create Virtual Environment (Optional)

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run FastAPI Server

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 4. Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Firestore (or Realtime DB) and Firebase Auth (Email/Phone)
3. Add Firebase config to frontend `.env` file (see `.env.example`)
4. (Optional) Deploy security rules found in `firebase/`

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables (.env.example)

### Backend

```env
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
SOIL_API_KEY=your_soil_api_key
FIREBASE_ADMIN_CRED=/path/to/serviceAccountKey.json
BACKEND_PORT=5000
```

### Frontend

```env
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxx
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-app.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-app
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
# Alternative: VITE_BACKEND_URL is also supported as a fallback

For Vercel deployments, set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the live backend origin in the project environment variables. Without it, browser requests stay on the static frontend host and marketplace API calls will fail.

For certified/bank report generation, the backend also needs a signing key source. In production, configure either Google Cloud Secret Manager (`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` + `REPORT_SIGNING_SECRET_NAME`) or `REPORT_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM` with a PEM-encoded Ed25519 private key.

---

## 🧩 API Endpoints (Examples)

### Backend (FastAPI)

- `GET /api/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}` — Returns current weather + forecast
- `POST /api/soil/analyze` — Send soil params (pH, NPK) to get recommendations
- `POST /api/crop/recommend` — Returns recommended crops for given soil & climate
- `POST /api/crop-disease/analyze-image` — Analyze an uploaded crop image and return the likely disease, confidence, and treatment guidance

(Document exact request/response schemas in docs/ or OpenAPI spec.)

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Frontend: use Vitest / React Testing Library
- Backend: pytest / unittest
- Add CI with GitHub Actions for linting + tests + deploy

---

## 🎯 Objective

Provide farmers with a lightweight, region-aware digital assistant that reduces risk, improves yields, and encourages sustainable decisions through actionable insights.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope & Ideas

- On-device offline support / PWA for low-connectivity regions
- Integrate satellite / remote sensing for crop stress detection
- SMS / WhatsApp alerts for farmers without smartphones
- Integrate local market price data for crop sale recommendations
- Train ML models using local farm historical data for precision recommendations

## 🚨 New Feature: Farming Mistakes Awareness System

This in-app guide highlights common farming mistakes and practical steps to avoid them. Examples include:

- Over-fertilization — how to test soil and dose correctly.
- Wrong irrigation timing — when and how to irrigate for best results.
- Poor seed selection — choosing certified, climate-appropriate varieties.

How to access: Open the Advisor page and choose the "Farming Mistakes Awareness" card to open the modal with examples, images, and prevention tips.

Acceptance criteria:

- Common mistakes are listed with an explanation of the problem.
- Each mistake includes clear, actionable prevention steps.
- Image examples for visual recognition.
- Responsive UI and no console errors in Advisor view.

## 🖼️ New Feature: Crop Growth Stage Visual Guide

A responsive in-app visual guide that walks farmers through the crop lifecycle: Seed → Sprout → Growth → Harvest. The guide includes stage-wise care instructions, image-based examples for visual learning, and a lightweight lightbox for inspecting images.

How to access: Open the app and go to the Advisor page — the "Crop Growth Stage Visual Guide" card opens the modal with the visual walkthrough and learning images.

Acceptance criteria:

- Seed → Sprout → Growth → Harvest stages represented visually.
- Stage-wise care instructions are shown for each stage.
- Image-based learning gallery with thumbnails and enlargements.
- Responsive UI and no console errors when used in the Advisor view.

Alternatives considered:

- Linking externally to a knowledge article or PDF (rejected — offline and discoverability concerns).
- A full LMS course module with video lessons (more content-heavy; deferred to Agri-LMS integration).
